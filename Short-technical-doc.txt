### Front-end 
I have used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to build up my front end

### Back-end 
- I have used node.js and Express.js for the server
- I have used EJS for creating templates that generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript
- I have used MongoDB as a database 

I have used node.js and Express.js becuase they are based on JavaScript
and they are the ones I decided to work with since I do not know any other I could 
work with. This was my first time doing something like this because I had to study 
a whole course that I did not manage to finish in 8 days, and that is one of my reasons
why I could not finish the whole assessment. 
I found it interesting in doing the assessment because I managed to study on how to do the 
assessment and I learned new things while doing the course. 
I wish I can submit the final assessment because I am very excited in finishing it and include
all the things I did not manage to add such as adding the avatar, CSS, search bar and etc. 
It waas really fun although I did not have enough time due to my academic and work
commitments.
